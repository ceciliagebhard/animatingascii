animating ascii frames using python

I have added a while loop to keep the animation in a loop. 
It doesn't consume any memory from the computer, since the frames are made of txt. 

Update: Using more frames (30 or so) and a time sleep between frames of 0.5 the movement gets as fluid as a film. 
The convertion of each frame takes more time, but you can add as many frames as you want.
